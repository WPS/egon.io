# Egon - The Domain Story Modeler

A tool to visualize Domain Stories in your browser.

## About

- See http://domainstorytelling.org for more information on Domain Storytelling.
- The [Egon.io Website](https://egon.io/) contains a user manual.

## Development

1. Install the dependencies via `npm ci`
2. Build and run Egon on a local development server via `npm run start`. Egon.io is accessible at http://localhost:4200.

Before committing any changes/creating pull requests, you should:
- Run tests via `npm run test`
- Run formatter via `npm run format`
- Check architecture rules via `npm run archlint`

## Architecture

See [architecture documentation](/architecture.md).

## Deployment

There are several deployment options:

- Standalone version (Zip file): If your organization already runs a web server, you can copy the zip file to the web server and extract it there to make Egon available to your organization.
- Docker container: If you prefer to provide websites as Docker container, you can build your own.
- If you don't want to build and deploy Egon.io yourself, than use one of the ready-to-use options provided by the Egon.io team:
  - Run [Egon.io online](https://egon.io/)
  - Download a ready-made Docker image `docker pull ghcr.io/wps/egon.io:latest` and run it `docker run -p 4040:80 ghcr.io/wps/egon.io:latest` (replace "4040" with whatever port you want to use)

### Build Standalone Version (Zip file)

1. In the package.json and environment.prod.ts update the version-tag appropriately
2. Run the command **ng build --configuration production**
   - This should create (or update the contents of) the folder **dist_build**
3. Run the command **npm run zip**
   - This should create (or update the contents of) the folder **dist** containing a zip.file named *egon-xxx*, where xxx is the name in the version-tag of the package.json

### Build Docker Container

1. In the root directory of your source code, run `docker build -t egon-dev .`
2. To start the container, run `docker run -p 8080:80 egon-dev`

Adapt container name ("egon-dev" in the above example) and port ("8080") as needed.
